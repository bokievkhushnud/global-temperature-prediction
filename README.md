# Global-temperature-prediction
 
### About the algorithms:
This is an implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the average global temperature with respect to CO2 and other Greenhouse gases.

### About the data: 
It contains data from 1751 to 2013, but it contains a lot of NaN values till 1880. Thus, during the data preprocessig the record from 1751 to 1880 will   be deleted. 
 
### How to run the code:
<ul>
  <li>Upload the source code to google colab or any other IDE that supports .ipynb extentions</li>
  <li>Upload the dataset and specify the path to the dataset in the source code</li>
</ul>
